---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Installation Problems

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fcntl'`
- **Cause**: Trying to use Gunicorn on Windows
- **Solution**: Use Django development server or Waitress instead
```bash
# Development
python manage.py runserver

# Production (Windows)
pip install waitress
waitress-serve --port=8000 core.wsgi:application
```

#### 2. User Permission Issues

**Issue**: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'`
- **Cause**: User attempting to export timetable without an assigned department
- **Solution**: Assign a department to the user or grant staff/admin privileges
- **Note**: System now handles this gracefully by allowing staff users to export all timetables

#### 3. Course Assignment Issues

**Issue**: "Cannot generate timetable. No courses found in the system. Please upload courses first."
- **Cause**: Attempting to generate timetable when no courses exist in the system
- **Solution**: Upload institutional courses first through the courses management interface

**Issue**: "Cannot generate timetable. No classes found in the system. Please upload classes first."
- **Cause**: Attempting to generate timetable when no classes exist in the system
- **Solution**: Upload classes first through the class management interface

**Issue**: "Cannot generate timetable. No halls found in the system. Please upload halls first."
- **Cause**: Attempting to generate timetable when no examination halls exist in the system
- **Solution**: Upload halls first through the halls management interface

**Issue**: "Cannot generate timetable. The following classes have no courses assigned"
- **Cause**: Attempting to generate timetable when some classes have no courses
- **Solution**: Upload courses for all classes before generating timetable
- **Prevention**: Ensure all classes have at least one course assigned

**Issue**: "Cannot generate timetable. Selected date range provides X days but minimum Y days are required (based on class with most courses). Please select a longer date range."
- **Cause**: The selected date range is insufficient for scheduling all courses based on the class with the highest number of courses
- **Solution**: Select a longer date range. The minimum days needed equals the number of courses in the class with the most courses
- **Calculation**: System calculates minimum days based on the class that has the highest number of courses assigned

**Issue**: "No courses found in the system. Admin must upload the institutional course catalog"
- **Cause**: Exam officers trying to upload class courses before admin uploads courses
- **Solution**: Admin must first upload the institutional course catalog
- **Workflow**: Courses → Classes → Halls → Class Courses → Timetable Generation

**Issue**: "Student count mismatch. Class size is X but you are uploading Y students. Please ensure the number of students matches the class size."
- **Cause**: The number of students in the CSV file doesn't match the defined class size
- **Solution**: Either update the class size to match the actual number of students, or adjust the CSV file to contain the correct number of students
- **Prevention**: Verify class size before uploading student data

**Issue**: `ImproperlyConfigured: STATIC_ROOT setting must not be empty`
- **Cause**: Missing STATIC_ROOT configuration
- **Solution**: Ensure STATIC_ROOT is defined in settings.py

**Issue**: `DisallowedHost` error
- **Cause**: Domain not in ALLOWED_HOSTS
- **Solution**: Add your domain to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py

#### 2. Data Import Issues

**Issue**: CSV upload fails
- **Check**: File encoding (must be UTF-8)
- **Check**: Column headers match expected format
- **Check**: No empty required fields
- **Check**: Date format is YYYY-MM-DD

**Issue**: Duplicate data errors
- **Cause**: Trying to import existing records
- **Solution**: Check for existing data before import
- **Solution**: Use unique identifiers (email, matric_no)

#### 3. Timetable Generation Issues

**Issue**: No timetable generated
- **Check**: Courses and classes are properly configured
- **Check**: Date range is valid (excludes Sundays)
- **Check**: Classes have associated courses

**Issue**: Scheduling conflicts
- **Check**: Class sizes vs. hall capacities
- **Check**: Course-class associations
- **Review**: Generated schedule for conflicts

#### 4. Distribution Problems

**Issue**: Classes not distributed to halls
- **Check**: Halls have sufficient capacity
- **Check**: Timetable exists for selected date/period
- **Check**: Hall configuration (rows, columns, capacity)

**Issue**: Seat allocation fails
- **Check**: Distribution exists for date/period
- **Check**: Student records exist for classes
- **Check**: Hall layout is properly configured

### Error Logging

#### Django Debug Mode
- Enable DEBUG=True for detailed error messages
- Check Django error pages for stack traces
- Review server logs for additional information

#### Common Log Locations
- Development: Console output
